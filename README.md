German credit risk classification using Machine Learning Algorithms


Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)



This paper provides and discusses the results of applying three different Machine Learning classification techniques to German Credit Data to decide whether to issue a loan approval or not. The goal of the German Credit Data classification is to increase the likelihood of earning from profitable loans while minimizing the likelihood of making risky loans to applicants. We go on to explore other issues such as data imbalance, model transparency, and bias. The applicant's socioeconomic and demographic profiles are taken into account before making a decision about his or her loan application.
